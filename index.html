    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <body>
        I am pretty new to web development, with only some prior experience from when I <i>tried</i> to self-learn.
    </body>
    <body>I am curently a junior at Dartmouth majoring in Computer Science. I am very interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, but as mentioned before, have wanted to learn web development for a long time now!</body>


    When I'm not geeking out over CS stuff, I like:
    <ul>
        <li>Watching and critiquing horror movies.</li>
        <li>Playing video games (really into Octopath Traveler 2 and Overwatch 2 right now).</li>
        <li>Doing pixel art!</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- For some extra credit, I tried to do a little doodle (I am not much of an artist): -->
