            I am pretty new to web development, with only some prior experience from when I <i>tried</i> to self-learn. 
            I am curently a junior at Dartmouth majoring in Computer Science. 
            I am very interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence but have wanted to learn web development for a while now.

                <li>
                    Watching and critiquing horror movies.
