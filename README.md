## What Didn’t Work

- received the error `zsh: command not found: python` when using command `python -m http.server 9000` to test locally
    - had to use command `python3 -m http.server 9000` instead because of my python configurations
- had a lot of trouble because I had used my free GitHub pages from Namecheap over a year ago and I could not find any record of my previous domain (`bansharee.me`) on Namecheap on my account dashboard
    - I ended up finding an old email from Namecheap asking me to verify my school email (my primary email, not an alias, which was the email I previously used for `bansharee.me`; clicking on it somehow allowed me to create a different domain `banshareeireen.me` with the free GitHub page option). Not sure why that happened as I’m pretty certain I used my primary school email for both of these domains and I assumed that’s not supposed to be possible?
    - I am going to be using this domain, but I also created an email alias in case something happens to it and I need to redo it

## What Did Work

- the suggestion to check Namecheap’s Dashboard to check for a *URL Redirect Record / CNAME Record* was helpful! I was running into an error message until I went to check this and using the solution provided in the instructions fixed it!
